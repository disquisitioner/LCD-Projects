LCD Projects
===============
Inexpensive LCD displays are excellent ways to allow Arduino-based projects to provide information to users, which otherwise could only communicate by blinking their on-board LED.  Many such displays are low-resolution character-oriented panels, which often is enough.  You can, though, find LCD panels with enough addressable pixels to do graphics.  One of my favorite of those is the LCD panel manufactured years ago for Nokia phones.

I've accumulated a variety of LCD display projects here.

**BasicLCD**
Very simple test sketch for a sixteen character by two line LCD panel

**LCD_Red_Message**
Simple test sketch for a 16x2 LCD panel with an RGB backlight LED, allowing you to alter the color of the text or background.

**Multicolor_LCD**
Cycles through colors on a 16x2 RGB-backlit LCD

**PCDTest_Orangemoose**
Code for the Sparkfun breakout version of the Nokia 5100 LCD that displays my typical "Orangemoose" test bitmap.  (It uses the Adafruit PCD8544 library and is based on their example code.  I try and learn from everyone...)

**TempHumidity**
Simple temperature and humidity display using an HTU21D sensor and 16x2 LCD panel.
